\chapter*{Abstract}\label{c0}

Nowadays, most of the computing systems are based on service-oriented computing (SOC). 
This paradigm aims at replacing complex monolithic systems by a composition of interacting systems
called services. A service encapsulates self-contained functionality and offers it over
a well-defined and standardized interface. It allows cross-organizational collaborations 
in which each participant is in charge of a particular tasks leading to 
the development of scalable, flexible and low-cost distributed applications. Each service
works as an autonomous component, performing only the tasks for which it has been implemented. 
As the development of such services is independent, companies can reuse a considerable amount of components, 
thus saving money and time. Moreover, these technologies are widely used 
due to their ability to provide interoperability among services 
from different companies since all the participants know the services offered by the others as well as how to access them. 

Due to privacy concerns or commercial policy, entities participating in one of 
these architectures have no access to complete information, that is, 
he code implementing the services the particpants consume is hidden, 
thus being impossible to examine or verify the implementation of the consumed services.
Another issue is that web services are usually \emph{stateless},
which means that no state is stored from the clients viewpoint. 
However, some new applications and services have emerged, which
require to capture the state of some resources. Thus,
new standards to manage the state of a web service have appeared. For instance,
Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) was conceived to allow designers to manage resources when using web services, and
this standard became Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) when new improvements were introduced. 

Obviously, in this scenario the probability of making errors is higher than working in a monolithic scenario. Therefore, there is
a clear need of applying any kind of technique to ensure the correctness of each participant and their composition.
In this Thesis, we present a formal language called BPELRF and its semantics. The aim of this language is
to model a set of bussiness processess implemented in the de-facto standard modelling language, WS-BPEL, but
enriched with the ability to manage distributed resources. These distributed resources are managed according to
the guidelines provided by the standard WSRF. Moreover, we provide a visual model of this language in terms of 
coloured Petri nets in order to ease uninitiated people to deal with it, and we use the well-known toolbox, CPNTools,
to verify the composition of web services with distributed resources expressed in BPELRF. As usual, the process of building manually
the Petri nets model of large scenarios is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore,
we have implemented a tool to support web designers that, given a BPELRF specification, it extracts automatically the coloured 
Petri nets of the scenario. Finally, this model can be verified using CPNTools.

On the second part of the Thesis, we extend the classical definition of Workflow nets with time features. 
Workflow nets were introduced 
by Wil van der Aalst as a formalism
for the modelling, analysis and verification of business workflow processes.
%to model, validate and verify business process, \emph{workflow nets} (wf-nets) \cite{Aalst97,Aalst98}. 
The formalism is based on Petri nets abstracting away most of the data 
while focusing on the possible flow in the system. 
Its intended use is in finding design errors 
such as the presence of deadlocks, livelocks 
and other anomalies in workflow processes. Such correctness criteria can
be described via the notion of \emph{soundness} that
requires the option to complete the workflow, guarantees proper termination
and optionally also the absence of redundant tasks. 

After the seminal work on workflow nets, researchers have 
invested much effort in defining new soundness criteria and/or 
improving the expressive power of the original model by adding new features 
and studying the related decidability and 
complexity questions.
%such as reset or inhibitor arcs, resources, time or multiple instances. 
%It is impossible and is also out of the scope of this paper to summarise here all
%of these works, and, therefore, we refer the interested reader to \cite{AalstHHSVVW11} for further information. 
%Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to
%mention that there is a common characteristic in all of this extended models: undecidability. Thus, soundness (or its different variants)
%is decidable for classical workflow nets \cite{Aalst97}, but, for instance, it is undecidable when we add reset or inhibitor arcs \cite{AalstHHSVVW11}.
In this Thesis, we define a quantitative extension of workflow 
nets with timing features called timed-arc Workflow nets. It allows us to argue, among others, 
about the execution intervals of tasks, deadlines and urgent behaviour of workflow processes. Our workflow
model is based on timed-arc Petri nets
where tokens carry timing information
and arcs are labelled with time intervals restricting the available
ages of tokens used for transition firing. Here, we consider both discrete and continuous time
semantics, thus conforming a whole theory of workflow nets. Finally, all the theory presented in 
this thesis have been introduced in the tool Tapaal, offering researchers a mean to model 
timed-arc workflow nets and to automatically verify (strong) soundness.
