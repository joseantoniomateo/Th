\section{Motivation}\label{scope}
\markright{~\ref{scope}Motivation}

The development of software systems is becoming more complex with the 
appearance
of new computational paradigms such as Service-Oriented  Computing  (SOC), 
Grid Computing and Cloud Computing.
In these systems, the service provider needs to ensure some levels of 
quality and privacy to the final
user in a way that had never been raised. It is therefore necessary 
to develop new techniques to benefit from the advantages 
of recent approaches, as Web service compositions. 
Formal models of concurrency have been widely used for the description and analysis of concurrent and distributed systems. 
Grid/Cloud environments are characterized by a dynamic environment 
due to the heterogeneity and volatility of resources. 
To composite web services, there are two complementary views: Choreography and Orchestration. 
The choreography view describes the observable interactions among services and can
be  defined  by  using  specific  languages such as Web  Services
Choreography  Description  Language  (WS-CDL) %\cite{WSCDL}
or  by
using more general languages like UML Messages Sequence
Charts (MSC). On the other hand, orchestration concerns
the internal behaviour of a Web service in terms of invocations
to  other  services.  Web Services Business 
Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) \cite{Andrews2003WSBPEL} is normally used 
to describe Web service orchestrations, so this
is considered the de-facto standard language for describing Web services
workflows in terms of web service compositions. Later on, a brief introduction of WS-CDL is provided, and
a deep description of WS-BPEL is introduced since it will be used as part of this work.

To facilitate additional interoperability among services, more standardization is required to deal with distributed resources. In January of 2004, several members of the \emph{Globus Alliance} organization and the computer multinational \emph{IBM} with the help of experts from companies such as \emph{HP, SAP, Akamai, etc.} defined the basis architecture and the initial specification documents of a new standard for that purpose, Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF)~\cite{Foster2004}. Although the Web service 
definition does not consider the notion of state, interfaces frequently provide the user with the ability to access and manipulate
states, that is, data values that persist across, and evolve as a result of Web service interactions. The messages that the services 
send and receive imply (or encourage programmers to infer) the existence of an associated stateful resource. It is then desirable 
to define Web service conventions to enable the discovery of, introspection on, and interaction with stateful resources in standard 
and interoperable ways~\cite{Czajkowski2004}. 

The main motivation of the first part of the Thesis is to provide a formal 
semantics for WS-BPEL+WSRF to manage stateful Web services workflows 
by using the existing machinery in distributed systems,
and specifically a well-known formalism, such as prioritised-timed
coloured Petri nets, which apart of being a graphical model, but they also
provide us an easier way to simulate and analyse the modelled
system. Thus, our aim is not to provide just another WS-BPEL semantics. 
In order to deal with the integration of BPEL plus WSRF in a proper way, 
we have realized that it is more convenient 
to introduce a specific semantic model, which  covers 
properly all the relevant aspects of WSRF such as notifications and 
resource time-outs. 
The integration of WS-BPEL and WSRF is not new; in the literature, 
there are a bundle of works defining this integration, but 
none of these works define a formal semantics in terms of Petri
nets.

\section{Objectives}\label{objectives}

Next, we describe the general and specific objectives of the Thesis.

\subsection*{Main Objective}

The main objective of the Thesis can be splitted into two main objectives. 
The first one is the definition of a formal language to model Grid/Cloud Computing environments, 
reusing some of the web technologies presented to date. 
The second one is to propose a new extension of workflow nets in terms 
of timed-arc Petri nets, thus providing two formal models in which the time semantics is discrete or continuous. 
Obviously, these objectives are too general and, therefore, we list below a set of subobjectives that are
required to achieve these overall objectives.


\subsection*{Specific Objectives}

To meet this overall objectives the following specific objectives should be achieved:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf {Objective 1: State-of-the-art}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Study of different formalisms for the modelling and analysis of Grid/Cloud Computing applications using web services.

\item Summarise the current definitions of soundness and the different extensions of workflow nets presented to date.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Objective 2: Technological framework definition}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Study of the current techniques for modelling and implementing Web service composition and Grid/Cloud Computing applications.

\item Analyse the different tools for modelling workflow nets as well as possible target applications of the theory presented in this Thesis.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Objective 3: Development of the proposal}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Define the specific models, either the operational semantics or the PTCPNs semantics of the language BPELRF.

\item Extend the current definition of workflow nets with a time semantics.

\item Adapt the definition of soundness to this timed scenario.

\item Develop tools within the theory presented here.

\item Analyse and evaluate both proposals.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Objective 4: Examples and Case studies}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Propose a set of simple examples where the main features are displayed.
\item Study a set of theoretical examples where the power of both proposals and its main aspects is characterized .
\item Demonstrate the applicability of this work applying it to real (industry-based) case studies.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\section{Dissertation Structure}\label{structure}
\markright{~\ref{structure} Dissertation Structure}

This Thesis is organised in five different chapters as follows.

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c1}} makes a brief introduction of the Thesis, showing the motivation, the main objectives and the scope of it.

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c2}} shows the state of art of the contents included here. This chapter includes a brief description of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) and distributed computing, e.g. Grid and Cloud computing and the use of formal methods for the analysis of web service compositions and the benefits of using formal techniques in the development of software and hardware. Moreover, a deep introduction of the standards used in this work is presented. Finally, we get into workflow nets and the possible extension of this formal model as well as its main properties.

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c3}} presents a formal specification language called BPELRF, which takes two well-known standards (WS-BPEL and WSRF) as basis, to model synchronous and asynchronous stateful interactions. This language is enriched with a publish-subscribe architecture, service discovery, event and fault handling and time-outs. As usual, an operational semantics for this language is defined. Moreover, we define a visual model of it in terms of coloured Petri nets and a tool to verify some properties of the specifications written in BPELRF.

In \textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c4}} we suggest a workflow model based on timed-arc Petri nets and study
the foundational problems of soundness and strong (time-bounded) soundness.
We explore the decidability of these problems
and compare the discrete and continuous semantics of timed-arc
workflow nets. 

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c5}} shows the main conclusions, contributions and future works of this Thesis.
