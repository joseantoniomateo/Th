Recordar incluir los challenges of workflow modelling (resaltar el tiempo y la tool).

Analysis of workflow processes with quantitative aspects
like timing is of interest in numerous time-critical applications. 
We suggest a workflow model based on timed-arc Petri nets and study
the foundational problems of soundness and strong (time-bounded) soundness.
We explore the decidability of these problems
and show, among others, that soundness is decidable for monotonic 
workflow nets while reachability is undecidable.
For general timed-arc workflow nets soundness and
strong soundness become undecidable, though we can design efficient
verification algorithms for the subclass of bounded nets. 
Finally, we compare the discrete and continuous semantics of timed-arc
workflow nets and demonstrate the usability of our theory on
the case studies of a Brake System Control Unit used in aircraft certification,
the MPEG2 encoding algorithm, and 
a blood transfusion workflow.
%, the benchmarking case study of the little-JIL language. 
The implementation of the algorithms is  
freely available as a part of the model checker TAPAAL.
