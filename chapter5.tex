\chapter{Timed-arc workflow nets}\label{chapter:c5}
\markboth{Chapter~\ref{chapter:c5}.}{}

In this chapter, we define a framework for modelling business process in terms of timed-arc workflow nets. Here, 
we present a workflow theory based on timed-arc Petri nets,
extend the notion of soundness from~\cite{Aalst97} to deal with 
timing features and introduce a new notion of strong soundness
that guarantees time-bounded workflow termination. We study
the decidability/undecidability of soundness and strong soundness
and conclude that even though they are in general undecidable,
we can still design efficient verification algorithms for two important
subclasses: monotonic workflow nets 
(not using any inhibitor arcs, age invariants and urgent transitions)
and for the subclass of bounded nets. 
This contrasts to the fact that for example the reachability
question for monotonic workflow nets is already 
undecidable~\cite{RGE:reachability}. 
Moreover, our algorithms 
allow us to compute the minimum and maximum execution times of the
workflow. The theory is developed for
discrete-time semantics but in Section~\ref{sec:cont} we discuss its
relationship to the continuous-time semantics. Finally, we implement
the algorithms given here within the open-source tool 
TAPAAL~\cite{DJJJMS:TACAS:12} and successfully demonstrate on a number of 
case studies the applicability of the theory in real-world scenarios.

Analysis of workflow processes with quantitative aspects
like timing is of interest in numerous time-critical applications. 
For instance, workflow nets have been used in various works to provide a formal
model for some WS-BPEL constructions e.g. \cite{AalstJL05,Ouyang2007,AalstL08,LohmannK08,Lohmann07}.
We suggest in this chapter a workflow model based on timed-arc Petri nets and study
the foundational problems of soundness and strong (time-bounded) soundness.
We explore the decidability of these problems
and show, among others, that soundness is decidable for monotonic 
workflow nets while reachability is undecidable.
For general timed-arc workflow nets soundness and
strong soundness become undecidable, though we can design efficient
verification algorithms for the subclass of bounded nets. 
Finally, we compare the discrete and continuous semantics of timed-arc
workflow nets and demonstrate the usability of our theory on
the case studies of a Brake System Control Unit used in aircraft certification,
the MPEG2 encoding algorithm, and 
a blood transfusion workflow.
%, the benchmarking case study of the little-JIL language. 
The implementation of the algorithms is  
freely available as a part of the model checker TAPAAL \cite{tapaal}.

We demonstrate the usability of our framework on three case studies.
The studied workflows were modelled and verified with the help of 
a publicly available\footnote{Workflow extension is currently available 
as a beta-release at the bottom of the download section at www.tapaal.net.},
open-source tool TAPAAL~\cite{DJJJMS:TACAS:12}, where
the algorithms presented in this paper are efficiently implemented
in C++. The tool provides a convenient GUI support and
one of the main advantages of our tool is the visualization of traces
disproving soundness (see~\cite{FF:AWPN:06} for more discussion on 
this topic).

In the Brake System Control Unit (BSCU) case study, a part of a 
Wheel Braking System (WBS) used for the certification of civil aircrafts 
in the SAE standard ARP4761~\cite{SEB:FESCA:13}, we discovered  
in less than 1 second that the workflow is not sound due to 
unexpected deadlocks. The authors of~\cite{SEB:FESCA:13} 
were able to detect these problems asking a reachability query,
however, the error traces contradicting soundness were constructed
manually. Our implementation allows a fully automatic detection and
visualization of such situations.

In the second case study describing the workflow of MPEG2 encoding algorithm
run on a multicore processor (Petri net model was taken 
from~\cite{PCVMP:MMM:04}), we verified in about 10 seconds 
both soundness and strong soundness, and computed 
the minimum and maximum encoding time for the IBBP frame sequence.

In the third case study, we checked the soundness 
of a larger blood transfusion workflow~\cite{blood-benchmark},
the benchmarking case study of the little-JIL language. 
The Petri net model was suggested in~\cite{BLS:FHIES:12} but we discovered 
several issues with improper workflow termination that were fixed
and then both soundness and strong soundness was confirmed
in about 1 second, including the information about the minimum 
and maximum execution times. 

TAPAAL models of all case studies can be obtained from www.tapaal.net
and Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot} shows a screenshot of the GUI in the
trace debugging mode for workflow analysis of the brake system control 
unit mentioned above.

\section{Summary}\label{sumWorkflow}
\markright{~\ref{sumWorkflow} Summary}

We presented a framework for modelling of timed workflow processes
via timed-arc workflow nets and studied the classical problem of
soundness and its extension to time-bounded (strong) soundness.
We provided a comprehensive analysis of decidability/undecidability
of soundness and strong soundness on different subclasses of timed-arc
workflow nets. We also suggested efficient algorithms for computing
minimum and maximum execution times of a given workflow and implemented
all algorithms within the tool TAPAAL~\cite{DJJJMS:TACAS:12}. 
As a result we have a complete theory for checking soundness on
timed workflow nets and contrary to many other papers studying
different variants of workflow processes, we took a step further
by providing efficient implementation of the algorithms, including
a platform independent GUI support for modular design of timed
workflow nets and visual error trace debugging. The tool is open-source
and freely available at \url{www.tapaal.net}.
The practical usability of 
the approach was documented on three industry-inspired case studies,
demonstrating a very promising potential for verification of larger
timed workflows.

In the study we focused on the discrete semantics 
of workflow nets that is often sufficient and allows for modelling
of workflows where events can happen in discrete steps.
Nevertheless, we argued that many of the results
are valid also for the continuous semantics. In fact, once we
know that a given net is sound in the continuous semantics,
it is enough to check for strong soundness and minimum/maximum
execution times in the discrete semantics and these answers
are valid also for the continuous case. As a future work, we 
are developing efficient algorithms to decide soundness 
of bounded timed-arc workflow nets in the continuous semantics.
