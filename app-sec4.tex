\section{Proofs from Section~\ref{sec:strong}} \label{app:undecid2}

\noindent {\bf Theorem~\ref{thm:strong-undecid}.}
{\em Strong soundness of ETAWFN is undecidable.}
\begin{proof}
Similarly as in Theorem~\ref{thm:undecid},
we reduce the reachability problem for
two-counter Minsky machines into checking strong soundness. We can use
the same construction as in Figure~\ref{fig:cont} each place
$p_i$ contains the age invariant $\leq 1$ and hence there are no divergent
markings. At the same time, before executing any instruction we have to
wait exactly one time unit, hence there is no infinite computation of the
workflow net that happens during a fixed time bound. As a result,
the workflow net constructed in Figure~\ref{fig:cont} is sound if and only
if it is strongly sound and the undecidability result in 
Theorem~\ref{thm:undecid} is valid also for strong soundness.
\qed
